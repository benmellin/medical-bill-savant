A website that helps you negotiate medical bills.



[Medical Bill Savant](https://medicalbillsavant.com) (MBS) is a tool to help you fight the exploitative billing practices of hospitals and clinics. MBS compares your bill to fair prices for your procedures, and then automatically generates a negotiation letter based on this information.

Most patients don’t realize that medical bills are often negotiable, and hospitals or providers may reduce charges if asked. Knowing your options—like requesting discounts, payment plans, or fair-price adjustments—can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

To use MBS, first navigate to the Generate Your Letter page and upload your medical bill with CPT codes in PDF format. MBS then automatically identifies your charges, determines fair prices for the procedures using publicly available Medicare billing data, and generates a negotiation letter to your hospital or clinic.
